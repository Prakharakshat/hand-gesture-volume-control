# hand-gesture-volume-control
Control your system volume using hand gestures detected through your webcam. This project uses OpenCV, MediaPipe, NumPy, and Pycaw to track hand landmarks and dynamically adjust audio levels based on the distance between your thumb and index finger. It's a touchless, interactive, and real-time volume control system powered by computer vision.
